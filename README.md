This was a challenge project from The Odin Project curriculum, where the goal was to create a landing page. They provided a screenshot to replicate, along with the colors and fonts. From there, we had to figure out the best way to structure the page in HTML and then style it with CSS.

For the layout, I relied heavily on Flexbox because, unlike Grid, I use it more often and feel more comfortable working with it. After a few hours of work, I was able to achieve the result below.
